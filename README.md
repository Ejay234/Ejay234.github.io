  My name is Ejay Aguirre, and I am a student at the University of Utah majoring in Data Science. My academic and creative work is rooted in a deep commitment to community, environmental justice, and cultural storytelling. I’ve had the opportunity to work on projects that blend technology, design, and research. Some examples include visualizing environmental data and analyzing soil and climate data to inform sustainable practices. I was a CI Compass Fellow where I learned many things about cyberinfrastructure which exposed me in experiences and knowledge in Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

      Beyond academics, I actively pursue opportunities that connect design, data, and community impact. I’ve also created digital art projects that preserve and celebrate Asian and Pacific Islander identities, blending cultural narratives with visual storytelling. With hands-on experience in mentorship, policy research, and client-based design work, I strive to create meaningful, inclusive solutions that reflect both cultural context and practical impact.
